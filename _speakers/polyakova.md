I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of California, San Diego. I am a member of the Programming Systems group. I completed my PhD in 2014 at ETH Zurich (Switzerland), under the supervision of Bertrand Meyer. After that, I spent some time as a postdoc at MIT CSAIL, where I worked with Armando Solar-Lezama. I am a 2020 Sloan Fellow and a recipient of the 2020 Intel Rising Stars Award and the 2020 NSF CAREER Award. Since 2022, I am a member of the IFIP Working Group 2.8 on Functional Programming. My research interests are in program synthesis, program verification, and type systems.
