Jarosław (Jerry) Tworek – Jerry Tworek is a research scientist at OpenAI. He specializes in Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically using curricula, memory and representation learning to solve hard reasoning and control problems. Graduated with MSc in Mathematics from University of Warsaw and spent first five years of his career in the Hedge Fund industry. There, Jerry used optimization theory and advanced techniques of signal extraction from noisy datasets to research and develop quantitative trading strategies in futures markets, which finally led him to study reinforcement learning. Jerry took part in the robotics project "Solving Rubik’s Cube with a Robot Hand” which he later presented at NeurIPS 2019 DeepRL workshop. Currently works on evaluating and training big language models (GPT-3) to solve reasoning and logic problems.
