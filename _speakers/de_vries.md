Harm de Vries is a Research Scientist in the Human-Machine Interaction Through Language program at ServiceNow Research. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from Mila, Universite de Montreal, where he was supervised by Aaron Courville. During his PhD, he worked on machine learning methods for (visually) grounded language understanding. Heâ€™s currently focused on how NLP methods can improve human-machine interaction and is therefore interested in a wide range of research topics such as large language models, semantic parsing, task-oriented dialogue, and text2code. His research has been published in EMNLP, ICLR, NeurIPS, CVPR, and ECCV.
