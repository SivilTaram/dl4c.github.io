DL4C(Deep Learning For Code) is a new workshop that will be held virtually at ICLR 2022.


An exciting application of deep learning methods is completion, repair, or synthesis of program code. This field has received a fair amount of attention in the last decade, yet arguably the recent application of large-scale language modelling techniques holds a tremendous promise to completely revolutionize this area ([Chen et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374); [Austin et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732)). The new large pretrained models excel at completing code and synthesizing code from natural language descriptions; they work across a wide range of domains, tasks, and programming languages. The excitement about new possibilities is spurring tremendous interest in both industry and academia. Yet, we are just beginning to explore the potential of large-scale deep learning for code, and state-of-the-art models still struggle with correctness and generalization. This calls for platforms to exchange ideas and discuss the challenges in this line of work.


<!-- The theme is quite easy to use if you're familiar with Jekyll. The following collections are implemented:
1. **Speakers**: Curate a [speaker list like this one](speakers) from a set of markdown files, one per speaker. Crops and displays images if available. Adds a short bio. See files in the `_speakers` directory for examples.
2. **Organizers**: Curate an organizer list from a set of markdown files, one per organizer. See files in the `_organizers` directory for examples.
3. **Schedule**: Curate a [schedule like this](schedule) from a set of markdown files, one per event (talk, panel, break, etc.). See files in the `_schedule` directory for examples. Schedule items are sorted by a `sequence_id` attribute.
4. **Papers**: Curate a [list of papers like this](papers) from a bunch of markdown files, one per paper. See files in the `_papers` directory for examples. Papers are sorted by a `sequence_id` attribute if specifed (else they are listed alphabetically).

> **NOTE:** The best way to use these is to turn feature on or off by editing the `collections` attribute in `_config.yml`.

If you experience issues or have cool features to add, feel free to [fork this template](). -->
