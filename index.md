#### About

The second DL4C workshop will provide a vibrant virtual platform for researchers to share their work on deep learning for code, emphasizing recent advances and challenges, for example: HCI for Code, Evaluation for Code, Inference for Code, Responsible AI for Code, and Open Sourcing efforts in deep learning for code.

Please join us for a day of exciting talks, posters, and discussions on the latest advances in deep learning for code!

<!-- Our [call for papers](/callforpapers) is now open. Please submit your work by **February 3rd, 2023, 11:59 PM AoE**. -->

<!-- We are excited to announce our amazing [invited speakers](/speakers)! -->

<!-- The theme is quite easy to use if you're familiar with Jekyll. The following collections are implemented:
1. **Speakers**: Curate a [speaker list like this one](speakers) from a set of markdown files, one per speaker. Crops and displays images if available. Adds a short bio. See files in the `_speakers` directory for examples.
2. **Organizers**: Curate an organizer list from a set of markdown files, one per organizer. See files in the `_organizers` directory for examples.
3. **Schedule**: Curate a [schedule like this](schedule) from a set of markdown files, one per event (talk, panel, break, etc.). See files in the `_schedule` directory for examples. Schedule items are sorted by a `sequence_id` attribute.
4. **Papers**: Curate a [list of papers like this](papers) from a bunch of markdown files, one per paper. See files in the `_papers` directory for examples. Papers are sorted by a `sequence_id` attribute if specifed (else they are listed alphabetically).

> **NOTE:** The best way to use these is to turn feature on or off by editing the `collections` attribute in `_config.yml`.

If you experience issues or have cool features to add, feel free to [fork this template](). -->
