We invite original research paper submissions from a wide range of topics related to deep learning for code, including but not limited to:

* **AI Code Assistants:** full systems that support developers in understanding and/or writing code through, e.g., code completion, repair, synthesis, and/or verification.
* **New Representations and Model Architectures for Code** based, e.g., on grammar- and graph-based representations or integrating symbolic reasoning with deep learning.
* **Pre-training Methods for Code:** e.g., de-obfuscation of code, semantic similarity, and/or code completion.
* **Translation from Natural Language to Code or Vice Versa:** code generation, code summarization, semantic parsing, theorem proving, etc.
* **Static Code Analysis:** e.g., control and data flow analysis, parsing, name resolution.
* **Evaluation of Code Models:** e.g., correctness, systematic generalization, property-based testing, behaviour under adversarial attacks, security analyses, benchmarking.

Please consider submitting a paper describing your work, which can be research papers, technical papers, position papers, or system demonstrations. We are calling for short papers primarily (4-8 pages of content plus unlimited references), but longer papers can be accepted as well. DL4C is non-archival and thus dual submission is allowed where permitted by third parties. To prepare your submission, please use the LaTeX style files for ICLR 2022, provided at [https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/archive/iclr2022.zip](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/archive/iclr2022.zip).

* Submissions will open soon at [https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2022/Workshop/DL4C](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2022/Workshop/DL4C).
* **Submissions will close February 11th 11:59 PM AoE**.
