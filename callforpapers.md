We invite original research paper submissions from a wide range of topics related to deep learning for code, including but not limited to:

* **AI Code Assistants:** full systems that support developers in understanding and/or writing code through, e.g., code completion, repair, synthesis, and/or verification.
* **New Representations and Model Architectures for Code** based, e.g., on grammar- and graph-based representations or integrating symbolic reasoning with deep learning.
* **Pre-training Methods for Code:** e.g., de-obfuscation of code, semantic similarity, and/or code completion.
* **Translation from Natural Language to Code or Vice Versa:** code generation, code summarization, semantic parsing, theorem proving, etc.
* **Static Code Analysis:** e.g., control and data flow analysis, parsing, name resolution.
* **Evaluation of Code Models:** e.g., correctness, systematic generalization, property-based testing, behaviour under adversarial attacks, security analyses, benchmarking.

Please consider submitting a paper describing your work, which can be research papers, technical papers, position papers, or system demonstrations. We are calling for short papers primarily (4-8 pages of content plus unlimited references), but longer papers can be accepted as well. DL4C is non-archival and thus dual submission is allowed where permitted by third parties. To prepare your submission, please use the LaTeX style files for ICLR 2022, provided at [https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/archive/iclr2022.zip](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/archive/iclr2022.zip).

## FAQ

##### **Will the OpenReview be open to the public?**

Yes, **accepted** papers will be made public with author names and affiliations on the day of the author notifications.
The papers will also be listed on this website in the [papers](/papers) section.

However, **rejected** papers and the **reviews** will be private to the organizers and authors.

##### **Anonymity requirements**

Submissions should be anonymized for a **double-blind review**. We do not set an anonymity period.

That means you must submit your paper pdf with author names and affiliations removed,
but you can still share it publicly on platforms like ArXiv or on social media.

##### **Dual submission**

We accept submissions of the following types:

1. Fully original work not submitted elsewhere.
2. Work that is submitted elsewhere and is still under review. If you submit, make sure you are not violating the submission guidelines and anonymity requirements of the other venue(s).
3. Work that has been rejected at ICLR 2022.

Furthermore, for authors of work accepted at ICLR 2022 who wish to promote their work at DL4C, we will be happy to consider a dual submission. The DL4C organizers will decide if the work is going to be cross-listed on the DL4C website. The decision is based solely on relevance to DL4C; there will not be a review process for the work. Such submissions are exempt from spotlighting, and a poster slot is available upon request. Please [contact us](/contactus).

##### **How do I submit a paper?**

Go to [https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2022/Workshop/DL4C](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2022/Workshop/DL4C) and click on the "ICLR 2022 Workshop DL4C Submission" button.

Authors of papers accepted at ICLR 2022 who wish to submit their work to the workshop do so by [contacting us](/contactus) via email.

##### **Are we allowed to submit a paper with an appendix?** 

Yes, you can submit an appendix but reviewers will be instructed to only review the first 8 pages excluding references.

##### **How do I submit a poster?**

We are not accepting posters at this time. An announcement will be made once we do.

##### **How do I submit a demo?**

Please [contact us](/contactus).
