We invite original research paper submissions from a wide range of topics related to deep learning for code, including but not limited to:

* **HCI:** human interaction with DL models for code in various tasks and settings like code generation, translation, and repair including modeling human intent.
* **Evaluation:** benchmarks for DL for code standardizing how models are evaluated and compared.
* **Inference Methods:** improvements relating to, e.g., speed, cost-efficiency, or use of structured information provided by static analysis or dynamic program execution.
* **Responsible AI:** being fair, civil, secure, robust, and respecting privacy and human rights.
* **Open science:** establish and follow open-science practices of sharing code, models, and data.
* **AI Code Assistants:** supporting developers in understanding and/or writing code through, e.g., code summarization, search, completion, repair, refactoring, optimization.
* **Learning from Human Feedback:** using techniques like RL for improving learning of DL models based on human preferences.
* **Representations and Model Architectures for Code:** based, e.g., on grammar- and graph-based representations or integrating symbolic reasoning with deep learning.
* **Pre-training Methods for Code:** explorations of data-preparation and pre-training strategies tailored for code.
* **Translation from Natural Language to Code or Vice Versa:** tutorial writing, code generation, code summarization, semantic parsing, theorem proving, etc.
* **Static Code Analysis:** e.g., control and data flow analysis, parsing, name resolution.

Please consider submitting a paper describing your work, which can be research papers, technical papers, position papers, or system demonstrations. We are calling for papers with 4 to up to 8 pages of content plus unlimited references. To prepare your submission, please use the LaTeX style files for ICLR 2023, provided at [https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2023.zip](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2023.zip).

## Important Dates

* Submissions will open on Dec 12, 2023 at [https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2023/Workshop/DL4C](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2023/Workshop/DL4C).
* **Submissions will close February 3rd, 2023, 11:59 PM AoE.** There is no separate deadline for abstracts.
* Withdrawals are possible until **March 3rd, 2023.**
* Accept/reject notifications will be sent **March 3rd, 2023.**
* Authors of spotlighted papers will be invited to give a short talk at the workshop and will be notified with details shortly after the acceptance notifications.
* Camera-ready pdfs and posters of accepted submissions are due by April 21st, 2023 11:59 PM AoE.
* Accepted submissions will be posted online on OpenReview and on the workshop website on **April 22st, 2023**, and not before. Rejected or withdrawn submissions will not be posted.
* The workshop will take place virtually on **May 5th, 2023**.

DL4C is **non-archival** and thus **dual submission is allowed** where permitted by third parties. Please see the FAQ below for more details.
Authors should check their email (and spam folder) for acceptance decisions and instructions on how to submit their camera-ready paper and poster by the deadline.

## FAQ

##### **Will the OpenReview be open to the public?**

We will implement the following policy:

1. All submissions will be private -- to their respective authors, to the reviewers assigned to review them, and to the workshop organizers -- until the camera-ready due date, April 21st, 2023.
2. We will communicate the accept/reject decisions individually and privately to the respective authors on March 3rd, 2023. The authors will be able to see the reviews and the decision on OpenReview, but no information will be made public until April 21st, 2023.
3. Accepted submissions (abstract + pdf) will be publicly visible only after April 21st, 2023, that is, when the camera-ready pdfs are available. At that point, everyone will be able to see the abstracts and the pdfs of the accepted submissions.
4. Rejected and withdrawn submissions will not become public.
5. Reviews will not be made public. They will be visible only to the authors, the reviewers who will have written them, and the organizers.

##### **Anonymity requirements**

Submissions should be anonymized for a **double-blind review**. We do not set an anonymity period.

That means you must submit your paper pdf with author names and affiliations removed,
but you can still share it publicly on platforms like ArXiv or on social media.

##### **Dual submission**

We accept submissions of the following types:

1. Fully original work not submitted elsewhere.
2. Work that is submitted elsewhere and is still under review. If you submit, make sure you are not violating the submission guidelines and anonymity requirements of the other venue(s).
3. Work that has been rejected at ICLR 2023.

Furthermore, for authors of work accepted at ICLR 2023 who wish to promote their work at DL4C, we will be happy to consider a dual submission. The DL4C organizers will decide if the work is going to be cross-listed on the DL4C website. The decision is based solely on relevance to DL4C; there will not be a review process for the work. Such submissions are exempt from spotlighting, and a poster slot is available upon request. Please [contact us](/contactus).

##### **How do I submit a paper?**

Go to [https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2023/Workshop/DL4C](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2023/Workshop/DL4C) and click on the "ICLR 2023 Workshop DL4C Submission" button.

Authors of papers accepted at ICLR 2023 who wish to submit their work to the workshop do so by [contacting us](/contactus) via email.

##### **Are we allowed to submit a paper with an appendix?** 

Yes, you can submit an appendix but reviewers will be instructed to only review the first 8 pages excluding references.

##### **Awards and prizes**

We will have awards at the workshop. The details will be announced later.

##### **How do I submit a poster?**

Accepted papers will be invited to submit a poster that will be displayed during the workshop. Posters can be submitted through the [ICLR Poster Upload](https://iclr.cc/PosterUpload) page.

##### **How do I submit a demo?**

Please [contact us](/contactus).
