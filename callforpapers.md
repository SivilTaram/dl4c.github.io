We invite original research paper submissions from a wide range of topics related to deep learning for code, including but not limited to:

* AI Code Assistants (full systems that support developers in understanding and/or writing code through, e.g., code completion, repair, synthesis)
* New Representations and Model Architectures for Code (based, e.g., on grammar- and graph-based representations or integrating symbolic reasoning with deep learning)
* Pre-training Methods for Code (e.g., de-obfuscation of code, semantic similarity)
Translation from Natural Language to Code (or back, e.g., code generation, code summarization) 
* Static Code Analysis (e.g., control and data flow analysis, parsing, name resolution)
Evaluation of Code Models (e.g., correctness, systematic generalization, property-based testing, behaviour under adversarial attacks, security analyses, benchmarking)

Please consider submitting a paper describing your work, which can be research papers, technical papers, position papers, or system demonstrations. We are calling for short papers primarily (up to 4 pages of content plus unlimited references), but longer papers can be accepted as well. DL4C is non-archival and thus dual submission is allowed where permitted by third parties.

# Important dates:

Our call for papers will close February 11th 11:59 PM AoE.
