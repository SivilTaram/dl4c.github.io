<p>Graham Neubig is an associate professor at the Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. His research focuses on multilingual natural language processing, natural language interfaces to computers, and machine learning methods for NLP, with the final goal of every person in the world being able to communicate with each-other, and with computers in their own language. He also contributes to making NLP research more accessible through open publishing of research papers, advanced NLP course materials and video lectures, and open-source software, all of which are available on his web site.</p>

<p>Jarosław (Jerry) Tworek – Jerry Tworek is a research scientist at OpenAI. He specializes in Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically using curricula, memory and representation learning to solve hard reasoning and control problems. Graduated with MSc in Mathematics from University of Warsaw and spent first five years of his career in the Hedge Fund industry. There, Jerry used optimization theory and advanced techniques of signal extraction from noisy datasets to research and develop quantitative trading strategies in futures markets, which finally led him to study reinforcement learning. Jerry took part in the robotics project “Solving Rubik’s Cube with a Robot Hand” which he later presented at NeurIPS 2019 DeepRL workshop. Currently works on evaluating and training big language models (GPT-3) to solve reasoning and logic problems.</p>
